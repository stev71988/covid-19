Using Python to map the spread of COVID-19

There's a lot of public datasets available online about the spread of COVID-19 across the world. However, they're all a bit complex and incredibly hard to read.

I thought it would be a fun experiment to create a script that could import this public data and convert it into a visually appealing graph that is much easier to understand. This script required many steps that are fundamental to every Data Analyst, such as importing complex datasets, cleaning the data, and synthesizing it in a way that's consumable for anyone. I documented my entire process in the attached jupyter notebook for anyone who would like to try this yourself.
